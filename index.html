                            SungKu Kang is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Northeastern University where his research interest lies in the integration of domain knowledge and artificial intelligence for design automation. Prior to joining the Automation for the Built and Living Environment Laboratory (ABLE) Laboratory, he worked with Dr. Ran Jin as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Data Science and Visualization (DSV) Laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University where he explored the extraction and utilization of domain-specific rules for design exploration. He received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University in 2012, and his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017 under the supervision of Professor Debasish Dutta. In his spare time, he likes cooking with his wife.
