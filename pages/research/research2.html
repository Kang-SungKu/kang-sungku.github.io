                        Supply chain, product, and controller are closely associated with
                        each other, since <strong>the design of one of them affects the
                        design of the rest</strong>.

                    <p class="description-main">
                        Therefore, <strong>it is desirable to have a holistic design
                        paradigm</strong>, such that a manufacturing company can adapt
                        to rapidly changing market trends and social responsibility.

                        However, <strong>design iterations of supply chain, product, and
                        controller are separate rather than integrated</strong>, where
                        each design iteration involves a complex optimization problem.

                        This <strong>limits the flexibility of the entire design

                        in one of the stages should be readily reflected (e.g.,
                        re-design due to a pandemic or environmental regulations).

                        This research aims to utilize <strong>reinforcement learning,
                        which enabled holistic decision-making in StarCraft II</strong>
                        by mastering resource harvesting, unit production,
                        and real-time control.

                    <p class="description-main">
                        Since the aforementioned tasks are analogous to supply chain, product, and
                        controller design respectively, I claim that <strong>reinforcement
                        learning has the potential to realize a holistic design paradigm in

                        This work will validate the feasibility of reinforcement learning to
