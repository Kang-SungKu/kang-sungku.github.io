                        However, stone masonry design is challenging
                        to solve with topology optimization methods, since
                        it involves the sequential organization of natural
                        stones for proper load transfer, <strong>where the
                        availability/shape/size of natural stones are random</strong>.

                        Therefore, stone masonry design requires <strong>adaptive
                        utilization of random stones to achieve the desirable
                        structural behavior</strong>, similar to what highly

                        Inspired by the similarity between Tetris and stone masonry,
                        a virtual design environment called MasonTris is developed,
                        where <strong>AI can learn stone masonry design via
                        reinforcement learning</strong>.

                        Inside MasonTris, AI autonomously explore different design candidates
                        by playing Tetris-like games, and then the design candidates are
                        evaluated with finite element analysis. The performance of each design
                        candidate (i.e., reward) is fed back to the <strong>AI to continuously
                        improve its design policy from experience</strong>.
